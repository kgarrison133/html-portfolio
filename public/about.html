<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Kenneth Garrison and I'm a software engineer. I have experience in Java, C+, HTML, CSS, software development lifecycle as a whole. I will graduate with a bachelors of applied science
  with a direct focus in computing technology and software development in the Summer of 2023. Beyond school, I still like to study. Since my degree is focused on the software development lifecycle and 
  mainly back end development using Java, I have taken a few courses on Udemy for Python and anther for front end web development, which covered HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, MongoDB,
  Web3, and DApps.

  Prior to college, I served in the Air Force for seven years. While there, I served as a logistics specialist and obtained the rank of Staff Sergeant.
  During my time in the military, I worked with the Communications Squadron for about one year, where I worked to fix the hardware on computers, assist with communications project management, 
  and assist with help desk duties. I then went on a deployment to Afghanistan, where I assisted special missions with logistics operations and other needs. While off duty in Afghanistan, I volunteered
  around 210 hours at the NATO ROLE 3 MMU hospital within the trauma unit.

  After comng back home from deployment, I decided to attend college for Nursing as I found a passion for medical during the time I volunteered in the trauma department. 
  However, I found that nursing school fell short of what my expectations were and I switched to software engineering. While it took me a while to find my passion for information technology, 
  I attended my first Hackathon at the University of Pennsylvania. During that Hackathon, I learned that in software development, you can make anything that you can dream of, which is an incredible
  concept to me. I truly love this career path because I can make new projects and bring ideas to life. 
</p>

<p> 
  Aftrer graduation, I hope to join a company that will allow me to grow my software development and programming skills. I think it is important to continue to learn because it will give 
  me the oppertunity to create more advanced projects and bring all of my ideas to life.
